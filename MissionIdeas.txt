9/7/2016: "No New Dawn", Advesrerial on Tora Bora [9/3/2016]
- Modern era weapons, US and Taliban

Mission name: Airfield Raid (see 8/29/2016 "All for One")
- Enemy QRF arrives and the OPFOR crawl through holes in the wall!
- Apparently, they have explosive charges to destroy ammo depots / fuel depot / key vehicles / key buildings
- This mission goes a lot better, and they ultimatley withdraw on foot to the north, extract by helicopter

9/2/2016: "Tank Infestation", Coop on Celle 2 [8/27/2016]
Mission name: Iron Curtain
- Modern era weapons, US
- Defending a town (Bergen)
- Combined Russian light armor and infantry assault; BLUFOR calls for air support (they have prop air support? - A10s certainly)
- Then tanks arrive. :D  The enemy also has Shilkas.  And a Hip.
- Dslyexci is overrun in the town and hides in a building hoping the enemy doesn't find him.  A few scattered survivors are hiding in the buildings.  He has some good dialogue in the last half of the video explaining his situation.
- A lone friendly tank (commandeered from the enemy) tries to rescue them.  Friendly air is Winchester on ammo.  But the AI doesn't clear the buildings.
- Dslyexci calls in A-10 on his position with GBUs; lies about his position so the pilot drops the bombs

  Helicopter insertion (MH-9), modern era weapons (BLUFOR), night, flashlights and flares
  - Investigate a small compound on the ridgeline? // make contact after arriving there?
  - Explore the nearby trails, make some contact close, move out along a trail and end up going into the jungle down a hill
  - Dslyecxi KIA as they exfil down the mountain
  - They withdraw to a village at the bottom of the hill

8/29/2016: "All for One", Coop on Chernarus [8/27/2016]
Mission name: Airfield Raid
"We're making an attack on an enemy airfield.  Our mobility is through BMDs, while we have several Hips acting as air support.  We'll dismount before making the assault on foot."
[Mission Briefing visible on "Stretch Goal: Extract" 9/5/2016]
** The invasion of Chernarus begins 0600hrs today.  Our company is spearheading the attack on the CDF airbase.  Primary objective is to destroy enemy air assets.  The airbase is guarded by one platoon of light infantry.  We will overwhelm them with superior mobility and firepower.
** Enemy: CDF Light Infantry Company (garrisoned at the airbase), CDF Motor Rifle Battalion, CDF Armor Company
** Friendly: VDV Infantry Platoon x 2, BMD-1P (2 per squad), 4 x Mi-8
** Mission: Storm t he airfield and destroy enemy assets; hold the airfield if able, otherwise extract to base after all targets destroyed
** Intent: Airbase lightly guarded by a few bunkers, use the elemtn of surprise.  Destroy as much military assets as possible before QRF arrives.  Hold the airfield if possible, otherwise withdraw.  BMDs have HEAT rounds, limited MG ammo - focus on hard targets.  2 x demo charges per leader, prioritize destruction of enemy air assets.  Mi-8 can be used as CAS or reinforcement transport.
** Movement Plan: Inf/vehicles deploy to red zone before game on, infantry stay mounted for initial assault.
