NOTES: Use pushBack to append to array instead of set on a new element, and especially better than appending arrays with a+b
??? How to store character classes ??? - create a standard array of all relevant classes with index values that correspond?
??? Do you want individual unit spawn functions (so you can control the loadout?) with an option for default loadouts?
??? Have those functions have generic names, and just run the appropriate script file depending on your faction?

--- Start with default loadouts, but do it in a function so we have the option for non-standard loadouts
--- e.g. spF_Rifleman (spawn friendly rifleman) - which looks up class names from a variable array
--- the array is defined in the particular faction file which uses pushBack
--- or, alternatively, use two arrays, one with the generic name the other with the class name and then use "find"
--- with a helper function to make encoding those values very easy - dictionary like - same for lookup

+ Add capturable trigger to zones (see initZones/createzone.sqf in original DUWS)
+ Implement and test facility spawn functions and files
+ Spawn zone garrisons (hold off on AP-generated patrols)
    --- Develop default side class configurations (for future modability of friendly/enemy sides)
        [Each side has a script file - the functions return arrays of classes so you can store them in global vars
        for the friendly and enemy side.  The files describe what classes are used for spawning patrols]
+ BLUFOR HQ spawn
+ LOGPAC GUI Interface (just requesting soldiers)
+ Squad Manager GUI Interface
+ Flesh out LOGPAC GUI for weapons, ammo, vehicles
+ Add basic support functions
+ High Command tie-ins
+ Persistant stats and unlockable abilities
+ Army Power patrols for BLUFOR and OPFOR

Extra Features:
+ Liberation-style shorter days as an option
