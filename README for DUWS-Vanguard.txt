DUWS: Vanguard

Version 0.01 (7AUG16):
- OBJECTIVES: Bare bones refactoring of DUWS
- Utilizes the dynamic weather / environment settings from DUWS-R 0.24
- Utilizes the default map texture off script from DUWS-R 0.24
- Refactored kibot's DUWS zone creation script for random zone creation.
- Minor bug: Some zones are partially overlapping, even though in theory that should not happen.
